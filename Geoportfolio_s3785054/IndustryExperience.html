	<div class="academic-intro">
		This page will briefly cover all my work experience (as of September 2022) within the geospatial science industry. The two main companies that I have worked at 
		were AAM Group and Tetra Tech. This page will outline my experience gained and skills I have learned from working at AAM Group and Tetra Tech along with an
		overview of my current geospatial skillset.
	</div>
    <div class="bar"><h3>AAM Group</h3></div>
	<img src="AAM-logo.png" class="company-logo">
	<div class="job-title">Geospatial Intern - Image Processor</div>
	<div class="job-time">April 2021 - March 2022</div>
	<div class="job-overview">
		My time at AAM Group was part of an internship for the thirty day work experience subject. The work experience subject taught me a lot about what industry
		standard work is done within the geospatial industry. I chose to work at AAM Group as I read about it online on how it is a large company that does a lot of
		geospatial activity and to my personal knowledge, is one of the few companies that specialise solely on different forms of geospatial work as their primary
		source of business compared to other companies that have a spatial team but the company itself does not specialise in geospatial work. The work at AAM Group in 
		the Melbourne office was less about performing geospatial analysis on pre-existing data, but rather capturing and collecting their own spatial data which 
		the mapping team process and edit into a usable form for the client.
		<p>
		As part of the mapping team, the work I was exposed to was editing and processing aerial imagery-based data. The work consisted of editing out distortions and 
		errors in the aerial imagery, manipulating colour bands of the orthomosaics to brighten or darken the imagery to the client's needs and creating Digital 
		Terrain Models from provided LIDAR captured imagery from elevation models. My work at AAM Group used less ArcGIS products than I initially believed, using
		other programs such as Global Mapper and AAM-exclusive products due to their Melbourne work being focused on aerial imagery rather than spatial data analysis.

	<div class="bar"><h3>Tetra Tech</h3></div>
	<img src="Tetra-Tech-logo.png" class="company-logo">
	<div class="job-title">Graduate Geospatial Consultant</div>
	<div class="job-time">May 2022 - Present (as of September 2022)</div>
	<div class="job-overview">
		My work at Tetra Tech as part of the spatial team involves using the ArcGIS suite for producing figures and maps for both internal staff members from other
		departments and entites from external companies. The work is primarily modifying and publishing maps based on the specifications outlined by the client, either
		editing the pre-existing data to be updated or creating new figures and information for visualisation on the maps. A lot of the work requires knowledge of
		programming languages such as Python, Visual Basic (VB) and SQL to assist with automating tasks and sorting through spatial databases and attribute tables. 
		<p>
		The work that I have done is not limited to spatial analysis. At one point, I was publishing raster datasets for Web GIS-use and another, I was checking off
		graphs to make sure that the graphs had all the data required on them, either adding the data onto the graph myself if the data is available or outlining the 
		graphs with the missing data for inspection by another staff member if I cannot add the data onto the graph myself.
