		<p>Melbourne, ranked the most livable city between 2011 to 2017 is well known for its multiculturality. Because of this attribute,
			Melbourne attracts many tourists domestically and internationally with more than two million international visitors and ten million domestic travellers visiting Melbourne in the year 2019. However, this would mean that out of the combined total of over twelve million travellers touring Melbourne, there will inevitably be at least one traveller who either gets easily lost within the city, unsure of which landmarks to visit, and sometimes both.
		</p>
		<p>In order to accommodate towards the tourists who would most likely face these issues, this interactive map will provide the locations of significant landmarks found within the City of Melbourne along with a short description about what to expect at each location.
